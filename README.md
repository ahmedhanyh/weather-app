# Weather App
In this project I'm applying my knowledge of Asynchronous JS (Callbacks, Promises, Async+Await) and
working with APIs.

This is an app that allows the user to enter a location then displays weather data about that location.
The app accomplishes this task by taking the user input, and making an API call to OpenWeatherMap's API
fetching weather data.
